Example:
"This image contains 1 person: A contemplative young woman in a sunlit studio.

Subject: Centered in frame, approximately 25 years old, East Asian descent, 5'6", slender build. Eyes are large, almond-shaped with double eyelids, dark brown iris with gold flecks, long natural lashes, slight upward tilt at corners. Nose is straight and proportionate with a medium-high bridge. Lips are full and naturally pink, curved in a subtle smile. High cheekbones, defined jaw, and oval face shape. Skin is clear with a warm medium tone, slight natural flush on cheeks, dewy texture with minimal makeup - just mascara and tinted lip balm. Three small beauty marks: one above right lip, two on left cheek. Hair is jet black with subtle brown undertones, waist-length, straight with natural wave at ends, parted slightly off-center, falling softly around shoulders. Wearing an oversized cream linen shirt, rolled sleeves, paired with high-waisted dark denim. Gold pendant necklace with small pearl. Expression shows quiet contemplation, gaze directed slightly upward, body relaxed but poised.

Setting: Minimalist art studio, late afternoon natural light streaming through large windows, creating a warm glow on skin and highlighting hair. White walls, wooden floors, easel visible in background. Professional portrait photography with shallow depth of field, shot on high-end camera."`

Create prompts that emphasize these key Ghibli artistic elements:

1. Painting Technique:
- Delicate watercolor-like brushstrokes
- Soft, visible brush textures in backgrounds
- Gentle color blending and gradients
- Hand-painted feel with natural imperfections

2. Character Rendering:
- Clean, precise linework for faces and features
- Soft shading on skin and clothing
- Natural fabric folds and hair movement
- Warm, gentle expressions with detailed eyes

3. Color and Light:
- Warm, natural color palette
- Soft pastels mixed with earthy tones
- Filtered sunlight and gentle shadows
- Atmospheric color gradients

4. Background Treatment:
- Impressionistic natural elements
- Layered depth with soft focus
- Visible brushstrokes in foliage and sky
- Subtle environmental movement

5. Atmosphere:
- Dreamy, nostalgic quality
- Natural lighting conditions
- Soft particle effects (pollen, dust, leaves)
- Environmental harmony

Format the prompt as:
"Create a traditional Ghibli-style painting in the warm, painterly style of [specific film reference]. Scene shows [detailed description] with [character details]. Use delicate watercolor techniques with visible brushstrokes, soft natural lighting, and gentle color blending. Include [specific atmospheric elements] to capture Ghibli's dreamlike quality. The style should emphasize hand-painted textures and natural imperfections, avoiding any digital or AI appearance."

Example elements to mention:
- Soft, diffused lighting filtering through leaves
- Gentle shadows with warm undertones
- Visible, delicate brushstrokes in backgrounds
- Natural color blending and texture
- Atmospheric effects like floating particles
- Impressionistic treatment of nature elements
- Harmonious color palette with earthy tones

Focus on creating a prompt that will generate an image with Ghibli's signature painterly warmth and natural imperfections.`
